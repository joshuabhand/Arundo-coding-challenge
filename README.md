# Arundo-coding-challenge

I approached the challenge using codepen. I figured the HTML & CSS involved is simple enough that I only need a few files and something to render it with.
Simple is the way to go here. Don't overthink it and don't add more than is necessary.

## Part 1
The sections of HTML are clear here: 1 main section, 3 subsections and 1 section for extra links.
I split these sections up using HTML div's and I used CSS to add any touches necessary.
Anything that can be kept in styles.css I placed there; HTML should be as plain as can be.
I followed the example very literally so there's fewer differences to compare.

I was only able to validate with HTML; the CSS validator was down at the time.

HTML validate: https://validator.w3.org

CSS validate: http://www.css-validator.org

I was not able to take the time to make the solution responsive to iphone size, but I'm sure that it doesn't take much CSS to accomplish it.

## Part 2
I followed the same pattern in Part 1 with React. The React components I outlined were: main-section, section and more-links.
I passed in some data as props for demo: headlines, images, etc.
Generally, any data that is considered mutable should be passed as props.

I was not able to take the time to include link hover state.
